Servings: about 8

**Ingredients:**

2 tbsp olive oil

2 onion, diced

4 carrots, diced

4 celery stalks, diced

4 cloves garlic, minced

1 bunch rainbow or swiss chard, stems removed and leaves rough chopped

2 russet potatos, peeled and diced

1 28oz container of chopped tomatoes (I use Pomi brand)

1 fresh rosemary sprig

1 32 oz container beef broth

1 Rotisserie chicken (store bought) bones discarded and meat shredded

Salt and pepper to taste

Add olive oil to a large heavy stock pot or dutch oven over medium heat.  Add in onion, carrots and celery and saute until onions are translucent.  Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds.  Add in the swiss chard and potatoes and saute for about 2 minutes, then add the tomatoes and rosemary sprig and continue saut√©ing until the chard has cooked down, about 10 minutes.  Add in the broth and chicken pieces and simmer until the potato pieces are tender, about 15-20 minutes. Fish out the rosemary sprig, then season with salt and pepper to taste.
